- app is a movie fight. search for 2 movies and compare with each other.
  ex. box office, critic rating.
- user may not remember full title, so may auto-complete inputs.

- plan: 1. set up boilerplate 2. identify challenges 3.get started and write a lot of code

- challenges:
  1. fetch data of movies
    - make network request to an API: omdbapi.com (free movie data api)
    - search then look up info
  2. build auto complete widget from scratch
    - auto complete later
  3. styling and css
    - Bulma CSS

- API
  website with instructions: https://www.omdbapi.com/
  key: 2d0ad63e
  Send all data requests to: http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&
  Poster API requests: http://img.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&
  - use axios for requests

- Searching
  - limited info when searching for auto-complete search.
  - more infor when searched specifically.
  - by search vs by id

- Autocomplete widget
  - good practice to go over design/steps. gives understanding of what is required.
  - user types and stops, widget will render possible movies user typed.
  - show poster and titles.
  - can close menu if nothing found.
  - user click enter => do nothing
    have user click on movie => update text and close menu
    user click outside menu => close menu
    later learn about scenerios
  - search for every keypress is not ideal
    should wait half a sec of user stop typing before making requests

  - want to wait for no further inputs then search.
    less taxing on the api.
    setTimeout() returns int value as identifier.
    debouncing an input.

  - debounce helper.
    onInput() => debounceHelper() => wrapper on onInput()
    wrapper will only allow last call that waited 1/2 sec.

  - awaiting async functions.
    render usable data in autocomplete widget.
    then select movie by clicking on it.
    return Search property.
    fetchData() is async, so need to await until response gets back

  - Rendering movies
    creat div for each movie found.
  
  - handle error
    case where no movie is found.
    we also want search to work on incomplete words

  - Next make it look like a menu with style
    smaller poster, next to title.
    use bulma.io to turn into menu dropdown.
    https://bulma.io/documentation/components/dropdown/
    instead of anchor, movie poster/title stick in a tag.

  - Styling the widget
    option 1: write out html
    option 2: code to autocomplete, create input, handle input
    basically have js do it all. bare root in html.
    option 2 very good, and for collaboration. all html changes are in js.
    create div in hmtl, then create autocomplete in js!
    that is very good!

  - HTML generation with js
    trying to use reusable code in js that generates needed html.

  - Note
    I might see an error saying picture is N/A but will fix soon after.
    !!!need to handle broken links!!!

  - Now need to fix onInput to take in generated values
    I think if i add more stuff to class=..., there can be multiple classes
    is-active class to open up menu
    next want to click out of menu. note that next search gets appended. need to replace instead.

  - Close menu when user clicks out
    remove is-active when user clicks out, if root doesnt contain the thing user clicks
    remove menu on empty search, and return early.

  - Handling movie selection
    follow up request => on click, send another request, this time pass in params i of selected movie.

  - Rendered movie stats
    next render second movie and then highlight higher stat of them.

  - Issues with codebase
    now want to refactor for reusable code.
    - code touches everything
    - not reusing autocomplete widget code.
    - currently hard to reuse, but have reusable code.
    - global variable makes it hard to reuse inside current program.

  - Plan
    - start with specific code in index.js, and reusable code in autocomplete.js
    - js file will take configuration object.
    - index.js => fetchData(), render option, onOptionSelect(), root element
    - autocomplete.js => take autocomplete config and render on screen
    - non-reusable in index.js, resusable in autocomplete.js

  - Displaying multiple autocomplete
    - first aim for multiple root autocomplete on a page at the same time.

  - Extracting rendering logic
    - next function is render option. return string html show inside dropdown.
    - make data customizable
    - refactor so it doesn't say movie.

  - onOptionSelect
    - now work on fetchData
    - don't make big assumptions of what data were working with.
      so no movies word

  - Different data
    - can use renderOption in index.js to get data from different api
      just change the code params and fetchData

  - Displaying 2 section of searching, and starting tutorial.
    start by contain in index.html.
    - is-hidden class will hide with bulma style
  
  - Compare
    - select element on both sides of screen
    - parse string
    - code can break if we re-order statistics
    - we can add a num property to every statistic, then eval using num property.
    - data-value=someNum

  - Questions
    data-value=, and dataset.value

  - Key points
    - widget to automate html.
    - run comparison by extracting in relevant values, stored in DOM. 
      then compare right away. basically processing upfront.

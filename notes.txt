- app is a movie fight. search for 2 movies and compare with each other.
  ex. box office, critic rating.
- user may not remember full title, so may auto-complete inputs.

- plan: 1. set up boilerplate 2. identify challenges 3.get started and write a lot of code

- challenges:
  1. fetch data of movies
    - make network request to an API: omdbapi.com (free movie data api)
    - search then look up info
  2. build auto complete widget from scratch
    - auto complete later
  3. styling and css
    - Bulma CSS

- API
  website with instructions: https://www.omdbapi.com/
  key: 2d0ad63e
  Send all data requests to: http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&
  Poster API requests: http://img.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&
  - use axios for requests

- Searching
  - limited info when searching for auto-complete search.
  - more infor when searched specifically.
  - by search vs by id

- Autocomplete widget
  - good practice to go over design/steps. gives understanding of what is required.
  - user types and stops, widget will render possible movies user typed.
  - show poster and titles.
  - can close menu if nothing found.
  - user click enter => do nothing
    have user click on movie => update text and close menu
    user click outside menu => close menu
    later learn about scenerios
  - search for every keypress is not ideal
    should wait half a sec of user stop typing before making requests

  - want to wait for no further inputs then search.
    less taxing on the api.
    setTimeout() returns int value as identifier.
    debouncing an input.

  - debounce helper.
    onInput() => debounceHelper() => wrapper on onInput()
    wrapper will only allow last call that waited 1/2 sec.
